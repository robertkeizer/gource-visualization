gource-vesualization
====================

NOTE: This project is not yet ready for anyone to use. It is just a dumping ground until I have some time to clean stuff up.

This project is a collection of scripts that query and massage data so that gource can be used to visualize other systems, not just source control.

```
./new.sh <path_to_trac.db> | gource -c 1.5 -s 1 --log-format custom -
```
